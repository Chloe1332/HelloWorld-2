    HTML is a coding language specifically made to code for websites, and HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is used to describe the stucture of websites, as in what things are bolded and their placement, along with displaying text. Finally, HTML also tells your browser how to show the website to the viewer.

      I enrolled in this course because I think web design is a useful skill. I could see it being applicable to many different fields and for personal hobbies. I also think coding is a lot of fun, and by extension, I am assuming this will also be a fun class.
